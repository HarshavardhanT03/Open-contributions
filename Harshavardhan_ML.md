## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

*This is a important tradeoff in Machine Learning Field*

```
    High Bias Indicates Overfitting in the model implemented on training set.
    Low Bias Indicates Underfitting in the model on training set.
    Always Bias is for evaluating the model with the trained dataset.
```

```
    High Variances Indicates model is overfitted in test dataset.
    Low Variance Indiactes model Underfits the test dataset.
    Always Variance is for Test/validation dataset.
```
    
> High Variance corresponds to Low Bias and Vice Versa.
> For a Good Model Both Variance and Bias should be leveled.
